# Summary
Hello! My name is JC. I am an aspiring Data Scientist and Education Technology enthusiast. I am deeply passionate about technology, mathematics, and education.

My current role is a Systems Grants Office for the Government of Ontario (Ontario Public Service). Prior to entering the government, my experience included over 5 years of lecturing, teaching, instructing, tutoring, and coaching roles related to university-level mathematics, business, and IT.

I have completed my Master of Education in Digital Technologies after graduating with my Bachelor of Information Technology in Networking and IT Security. In addition, I am currently progressing through Harvard Online's Professional Certificate program in Data Science.

Outside of my career and education, my hobbies include sports. To name a few, there would be running, archery, and golf. I always try to put myself in new learning environments to grow into a better person tomorrow.
